## Objective
Mercuryo team wanted to make the most useful multi-currency crypto wallet on the market. Cryptocurrency is a very interesting theme, but not as transparent as it should be. This is why our main goals were: safe and fast transactions, user friendly UI and an easy understandable flow.

## Result
We created the app by using high standards of personal data security. It was also really important to make simple onboarding and fast payments. Eventually, if you trust your money to the app, you need to always be in touch with it – that’s why we build easily accessible support right in the app.
