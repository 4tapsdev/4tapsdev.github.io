## Objective
Important part of Adapty is a mobile SDK – it’s a library that developers can install into their own applications. It had to be an open-source, scalable platform. The goal was to develop both iOS and Android SDKs.

## Result
We helped Adapty to outline the exact methods and API’s they need. Both platforms were implemented with 100% usage of native technologies and tools, without any third-party dependencies.
